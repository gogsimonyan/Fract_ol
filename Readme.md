##  Mandatory

- Your program must offer the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set.
- You must be able to create different Julia sets by passing different parameters to
the program.
- You must use at least a few colors to show the depth of each fractal.

## Compilation

- Clone repo and compile files into fract_ol executables via make.
- Note: For linux you need to install minilibx.
```sh
./fract_ol mandelbrot || julia
```
